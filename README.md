# Lab 8 - Starter
1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 
   1. I would want to do it whenever I commit and push the code. i don't want them to be local because other people may have different settings. I would want to run every time i make a somewhat significant and push it.
2. no i would use jest because end to end is not for a specific function and its output
3. no, i would use puppeteer because it is user input  and it has a lot of random elements, and it requires multiple functions to work together
4. yes, because it is 1 function that does it, doesn't require user input randomization, etc.
